## Projects

-Project 1: Mortgage Repayment Calculator and Interest Calculator
 - This project allows the user to choose whether they would like to calculate their mortgage repayments or their total interest on money in the bank.
 - This project uses variables and control structures to determine values over set periods of time.

-Project 2: Log-in System
 - This project was a workplace log-in system that read usernames and passwords from a separate file to allow the user to log into the system.
 - The file originally only had an admin account, but this account could add more users to the file.
 - The admin could then add tasks to another separate file and delegate them to different users.
 - The user could view the tasks assigned to them and mark them as complete once they had been completed.
 - The admin could view statistics about the tasks such as which tasks had been completed or were incomplete as well as tasks that were overdue.

-Project 3: Data Analysis
 - This project read from a separate file data about a variety of shoes in different regions of the world and allowed the user to return data on these shoes.
 - I created a menu that gave the user a variety of options such as re-stocking the shoe that had the lowest quantity and putting the shoe woth the highest quantity on    sale.
 - The user could view all of the data on every shoe in table format.
 - Another option was to search in a specific shoe and return the data on that shoe by entering in the code for the shoe.
 - The user could also capture data about new shoes and this would be added to the separate file.
